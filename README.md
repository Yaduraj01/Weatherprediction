# Weatherprediction
Weather Condition Detection using Deep Learning
This project uses a trained deep learning model to predict weather conditions from images. The model is built using TensorFlow and deployed with Streamlit.

How to Use:

Upload an image of a weather scene.

The model will predict the weather condition (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy).

The result will be displayed on the web app.


Model Info:

Model Format: .h5 (Keras)

Purpose: Weather Condition Image Classification

Framework: TensorFlow

This project is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.
